<h1 align="center"> Welcome to my Github! </h1>

Hello! I'm Brock Britton. I'm a software engineer living currently in Seattle, WA. Technology is my passion. I have loved technology from a very young age. I was able to start my software development journey in college. I then spent a few years working on a couple of personal projects. One of my favorite projects was a game about learning the pathways to a healthier life and the education of mental health. I value honesty, integrity, and transparency.

I love the software development industry as it gives me practical opportunities to make a difference by solving real-world problems. I am intrinsically motivated to learn, work with others, and further my knowledge and skills. I strive to utilize technology by working collaboratively and lead all of us toward a more accessible and accepting future.
