<h1 align="center"> Hey, I'm Brock! </h1>

I am a frontend developer specializing in React and React Native. I'm focused on identifying the moments where users are unintentionally challenged by their tools instead of being given the ways they need to accomplish their goals. Finding and eliminating those friction points is where I do my best work. I care about the details that make features feel intuitive: edge case handling, thoughtful interaction patterns, and reducing cognitive load.

My ongoing project is building accessible game and puzzle interfaces. I've always been intrigued by the complexity that can emerge from simple puzzles with straightforward rules, but I was often frustrated by how interface limitations create usability problems like difficulty taking notes, tracking state, correcting mistakes, and resetting to play again. I started with a digital bingo system for a group of weekly players frustrated by current equipment: losing pieces, keeping materials stocked, tracking wins, and auditory discomfort. I rebuilt the interface as a web app with caller/player modes, automatic called-number tracking, and support for multiple boards and custom winning patterns. Next up: crosswords, Boggle, and other puzzles we love - where the interface shouldn't be part of the challenge.
